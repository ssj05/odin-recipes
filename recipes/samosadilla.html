    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      While it's true a perfectly made, expertly fried, and quickly served
      samosa is superior to this version, that can be a very rare combination of
      events. By comparison, this quesadilla approach is almost impossible to
      mess up, and if you use enough oil in your pan, you should be able to
      achieve a beautifully browned, crispy crust that rivals something out of a
      deep fryer.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 serrano pepper, minced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 cup green peas</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped cilantro</li>
      <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut potatoes into 1/4-inch cubes. Transfer into a pot of cold water.
        Stir in salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Simmer over medium heat
        until cubes are tender but still hold their shape, about 15 minutes.
        Drain potatoes in a colander and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion. Cook
        and stir until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Meanwhile,
        combine 1 teaspoon kosher salt, garam masala, cumin, coriander,
        turmeric, and cayenne in a small bowl for the spice mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add serrano pepper, garlic, ginger, and the spice mix to the onions.
        Cook and stir until mixture is well combined, about 2 minutes. Add peas;
        cook until heated through and slightly tender, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer mixture into a bowl with the potatoes. Add cilantro and lemon
        juice. Mix with a spatula until filling is well combined, with some
        potatoes partially mashed. Add more salt if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine cilantro, mint, green onions, serrano pepper, lime juice, and
        yogurt in a blender. Blend until smooth. Season with salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a few spoonfuls of the filling over one half of 1 tortilla. Fold
        in half. Repeat with remaining filling and tortillas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook each quesadilla until
        browned and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer quesadilla onto
        your work surface and cut in thirds. Plate and serve at any temperature,
        alongside the chutney sauce.
      </li>
    </ol>
